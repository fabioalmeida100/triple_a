# Sample: Triple A approach in test automation

## Introduction

This is a sample project to demonstrate the Triple A approach in test automation.

## Getting Started

- npm install
- npm test

## The Triple A approach

The Triple A approach is a way of structuring your tests. It stands for Arrange, Act, Assert. It is a way of structuring your tests to make them more readable and maintainable.

### Arrange

In the Arrange step you set up the preconditions for your test. This can be anything from setting up test data to setting up mocks and stubs.

### Act

In the Act step you execute the code that you want to test.

### Assert

In the Assert step you verify that the code executed in the Act step behaves as expected.
